Placenoun is a Django project aimed at combining the utility of
http://www.placekitten.com with the generality of http://www.fuckyeahnouns.com

Placekitten allows you to construct a url in this format

http://www.placekittne.com/<width>/<height>/

So, typing in http://www.placekitten.com/100/200/ will result in 
placekitten serving you with a 100 pixel by 200 pixel image of a kitten.

FuckYeahNouns uses the Yahoo search api allowing you to type in a noun
and then be served with an image of that noun with the words "Fuck Yeah <noun>"
overlayed on top of it.

Placenoun is meant to combine these two concepts.  At placenoun
you will construct a url in this format.

http://www.placenoun.com/<noun>/<width>/<height>/

And you will be served with an image of that noun of width and height
specified.
